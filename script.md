Premise: Student returning home from school. The house is empty, and the student is bored.
The sequence of events will be:

1. Unlocking the door, opening it, closing the door
1. Taking off shoes
1. Walking over to the fridge and opening it
1. Taking out a can of soda, drinking it
1. Walking over and sitting down on couch
1. Turning on TV
1. Get text alerts, respond to those, while watching TV
1. Open backpack, start doing homework, while TV is on, while text alerts are on
1. Sound becomes overwhelming, student ceases all activity
1. Garage door, family comes into house, warmer atmosphere, neat conclusion
